/**
 * The server's own checkout — where the console keeps its `.data` files and where
 * host-side update scripts live. Deployments used to hard-code it as `/workspace`
 * (the Docker mount); it now comes from `RAC_SERVER_CHECKOUT` — compose sets that
 * to the mount, because the packaged image runs from `/app`, not from a checkout —
 * defaulting to the repository this server actually runs from (systemd, dev). The
 * host-side view resolves through an explicit env override or the configured
 * Project that declares this checkout (ADR 0003).
 *
 * `adapters/files.ts` has a sibling resolver (`hostVisibleRepoRoot`) for rendered
 * adapter files: env-only and fail-closed under the bridge, with no Project
 * fallback — deliberately different, because it gates Adapter launchability while
 * the config (and its Projects) is still being loaded.
