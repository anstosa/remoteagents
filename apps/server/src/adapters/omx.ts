/**
 * The OMX Adapter (ADR 0005). OMX (oh-my-codex) wraps the Codex TUI: its wrapper
 * process — `node …/oh-my-codex/dist/cli/omx.js` — launches Codex as a child and
 * stays alive as its parent, so the walker meets it before the Codex child and the
 * pane is badged OMX. What differs from Codex is the launch (`--direct`, forcing
 * OMX's direct policy inside tmux so it manages no HUD panes; `resume` forwarded to
 * Codex unchanged), recognition (the bare launch and `resume` are Agents, decided
 * from the first argument as OMX's own dispatcher does; hud/team/sidecar/mcp-serve
 * and every other subcommand are helpers), the structured question files OMX
 * writes, and the runtime-cleanup rules for its worker and HUD panes. Everything
 * the TUI itself does — title, submission, turns, commands, conversations, rollout
 * completion — is the shared `codex-tui.ts` object, so the two kinds cannot drift.
 *
 * The Codex-only console features (review tour, ChatGPT accounts, update advisor,
 * app-server command catalog) stay keyed on `adapters.codex`; an OMX-only
 * configuration does without them.
