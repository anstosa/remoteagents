# Worktrees are discovered from git; operator state is keyed by Project and path

Until now every checkout the console knew about was a `worktrees[]` entry in the config file, keyed by a hand-written `id` that also keyed notes, bookmarks, prompt queues and history, with `saveKey` to share some of that state across checkouts of one repository. The console is gaining git-worktree workflows — create a branch checkout, launch an agent in it, remove it when merged — where checkouts appear and disappear many times between config edits. We decided that config declares *Projects* (repositories) only; their *Worktrees* come from `git worktree list` and are never declared; Project-wide state (notes, bookmarks, saved prompts) is keyed by the Project id and Worktree-scoped state (queued prompts, history, last-used Launch profile, pin, custom label) by `<projectId>:<realpath>`; and which idle Worktrees keep a tab is a per-Worktree pin stored in `.data` rather than a config flag. We chose this because a checkout's lifetime is now shorter than the config file's, so anything true of one checkout has to live somewhere the console can write.

## Considered options

- **Keep declaring worktrees in config and add a UI that edits the file.** Every Add/Remove becomes a config write-back with validation and a restart-free reload the server does not have, and a worktree created in a terminal stays invisible until someone declares it.
- **Key worktree state by branch instead of path.** State would follow a branch re-created elsewhere, but detached HEAD has no key and a `git switch` in the main checkout would silently swap its history and queue. The path is the worktree's identity for as long as it exists; the branch is already recorded where it matters (review tours).
- **Auto-discover repositories too** (scan a directory for `.git`). Rejected: a Project carries trusted stack commands and push actions, which must be opt-in per repository.
- **`pinned` on the Project, applying to all of its worktrees.** Simplest, but a Project with several idle checkouts either shows every one or none, the operator has no say per worktree, and a checkout created from a terminal would either flood or hide the tab bar.

## Consequences

- **Config and data both migrate.** `worktrees[]` → `projects[]`, and every `.data` store re-keys: `saveKey`/`id` → `<projectId>`, `worktree:<id>` → `<projectId>:<realpath of that entry's checkout>`. Entries that were separate checkouts of one repository collapse into one Project. This is the part that is hard to reverse.
- **Mutable Worktree state lives in `.data`**: pin, custom label, last-used Launch profile, queued prompts, history. Operator-owned stack commands and preview endpoints may instead be configured by checkout path in `projects[].worktreeOverrides`; these settings never declare or discover a Worktree. Observation never deletes state; only a console-initiated Remove does, so a checkout that vanishes from git (unmounted, deleted by hand) leaves its records until an explicit prune.
- **The main worktree is the only one whose path may differ between the console and the host.** Under Docker `hostPath` maps it; linked worktrees are taken exactly as git prints them and must be mounted at the same absolute path (already the documented rule). An unmounted one is `prunable` and hidden — and `git worktree prune` must never run automatically, because from inside the container it would delete metadata for a checkout that exists on the host.
- **Wire ids carry the path.** `/api/worktrees/:id` takes the URL-encoded `<projectId>:<realpath>`; the web treats it as opaque. Browser-local per-worktree preferences keyed by the old ids reset once.
- **Identity is the common git directory**, so a Project may be configured through any of its checkouts, including a bare repository, and two Projects cannot point at the same repository.

## Amendment (2026-09-23): Places

The console's unit of navigation is now a **Place**: a Worktree, a non-git directory Project, or a Scratch folder (see the glossary). Before this, only Worktrees had an id, so directory-Project and Scratch Agents reached the dashboard with no Place to hang Terminals, pins or an agentless tab on. The id scheme above extends to every Place, and the association rule changes from exact equality to nearest containment.

- **Every Place id is `<projectId>:<realpath of home>`.** A Worktree keeps its wire id. A directory Project's home is its path. Scratch uses the reserved Project id `scratch`, so `scratch:<realpath>`. The configured Scratch folder is `scratchDirectory`, or the account home when it is unset.
- **A pane belongs to the nearest Place that contains its root** (git toplevel, else canonical cwd): the deepest Place whose home, or bridge host path, is the root or one of its ancestors. A root inside no configured Place is its own Scratch Place, `scratch:<root>`. One rule places Agents, counts Console shells and bounds the panes a Terminal may stream. It replaces the "matched exactly, never a prefix" rule for all three. Consequence: a nested, unconfigured checkout inside a Worktree now belongs to that Worktree, and a nested checkout that is itself a Worktree still wins because it is deeper. Launch adoption of an idle shell stays exact, because an adopted shell is where the Agent runs. The dashboard publishes an Agent's `placeId` and its Place's home. The Agent the server acts on keeps `home` as the root its pane runs in, because attachments, teardowns, file links, conversations and git actions all act in that folder.
- **Keys by Place kind.** Worktree state is keyed as above, unchanged. Pins key by Place id for every kind. The last-used Launch profile keys a directory Project by its Project id, as its launches always have. A Scratch Place keys by its own id and falls back to the `scratch` group record; both resolve in the scratch scope. Notes for directory-Project and Scratch Places stay keyed `scratch_<hash(home)>`, because a note key cannot contain `:`. A Place id is never a note key, and a console-launched Agent, which sits at the home, keeps its notes.
- **Accepted:** with `scratchDirectory` unset, every stray pane under the account home that is outside a Project lands in one Scratch Place, and its notes key follows that home. The console does not warn about this; setting `scratchDirectory` narrows it.
